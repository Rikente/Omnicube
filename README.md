# Omnicube
This is Operation Omnicube. I am creating a pool with all of my Magic: The Gathering cards from which I will then create any number of interchangeable cubes. Eventually this will include a cube construction tool, drawing from a provided inventory.

Cube is my favorite Magic format. It's very similar to EDH in the sense that you can use cards you wouldn't normally, but it comes with the added bonus of controlling which cards everyone at the table can use. This allows for a more easily balanced environment, since the context is being curated as opposed to a single deck within said context.

When this project officially started, I had three concurrent cubes constructed: Vintage, Peasant, and Abzan micro. The itch won't stop. I regularly find myself planning the next micro or theme cube. On top of that, as the cubes evolve and the archetypes become more solidly defined, I realize that certain reserved list cards (which I have no intention of rebuying) would be perfect fits in a different environment. Specifically, Survival of the Fittest would be a great card for the Abzan cube but is around $200 at the time of writing. Quite the conundrum.

Most people who play EDH have one or more decks constructed at any given time. A certain friend of mine does not take this approach, and instead has all of his cards sorted and sleeved, ready to be pulled into a deck on a day when we get together to sling some cardboard. This led me to the idea for Operation Omnicube.

I have recently sorted and cataloged all of my cards, except for EDH decks and cubes. My cards are sorted by color and then alphabetized. With this level of organization and specialized storage for my potential EDH/cube cards, I will be able to design a list using ALL of my cards as the base and pull the desired cards together with relative ease prior to a cube draft.

I will be hosting a website which will house my cube directory. In addition to the cube lists I will include a short write-up explaining the key cards for each archetype as well as possible overlap between them. This will provide my drafters an easy resource to learn about a cube before drafting it.

At the outset, I will be creating all of the lists by hand and iterating upon them as they receive testing. The stretch goal of this project is to create an application that can create a cube for the user, drawing from either all cards in Magic's history or a provided inventory. This application will allow for any number of design restrictions, such as size, colors, mana value, etc.

My inventory of cards is available at https://deckbox.org/sets/3077523. &nbsp;

The Operation Omnicube website will be hosted using AWS, no link yet available.
